# hackathon-nftberlin
The purpose of this project is to produce a unique audio-visual / representation of the signature / signature of an Urbit adress.
It takes the two words eg "master" "masrze" (or 4 sigils 'mas','ter','mas','rze') as input,
and creates a combined output :
- a graphical colored representation of the planet
- a set of 4 soundwaves

Both sound and image are one-to-one unique, making it less error-prone.
Only one of the two digital media is enough to verify the signature, even though theoritical.

It uses following components:
- https://processing.org/ for the 3D modeling and audio generation

Unicity is achieved by combining prefixes-suffixes to generate one wave/chord.
For the graphical part, we use a combination of (subject to change)
- Color, 2 sources of Light, Rotation.

To do list / Next Steps :
- Attach Urbit documents and sigils doc
- Sounds adds accessibility
